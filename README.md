# deep_comedy
A TensorFlow Transformer able to generate verses in the style of Dante's Divine Comedy

This project was developed as a part of the course *Deep Learning - Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna*.

The [report](https://github.com/Lostefra/deep_comedy/blob/main/DeepComedy_Report.pdf) provides an extensive description of the project, whereas the [presentation](https://github.com/Lostefra/deep_comedy/blob/main/DeepComedy_Presentation.pdf) enlights only the most relevant parts of the work.

The [python notebook](https://github.com/Lostefra/deep_comedy/blob/main/Final_DeepComedy.ipynb) provides all the code to initialize, train and test the Transformer architecture, and in the final sections it is given the code to generate a sample of a deep canto.
